Creep is a social experiment where I redirected people to whatever website I happened to be looking at when they visited creep.dskang.com.

`creep-client` is the Chrome extension that uploads the URL you're currently on and [`creep-server`](https://github.com/dskang/creep-server) is the server that redirect users to that URL.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

        npm install

2. Build extension

        grunt

3. Load unpacked extension in `chrome://extensions`
